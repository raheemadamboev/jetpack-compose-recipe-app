I used Jetpack Compose to build UI components. This is really easy to use, convinent and uses Kotlin to build UI. It is considered as future of android UI compared to old XML. <a href="https://food2fork.ca/">Food2Fork</a> API is used to retrive data. Both dark and light theme is supported. App robust to configuration changes and process death with the help of SavedStateHandle and thanks to MVVM pattern.
